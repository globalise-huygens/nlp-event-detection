# nlp-event-detection
This repository contains the pilot code for automatic event detection. It is a work in progress.
Currently, there are two finished folders. Each folder has its own readme. 

## Experimental automatic frame selection
This is code that extracts English frames that correspond to modern Dutch translations of predicates taken from the General Letters from two datasets: the nl-luIndex and the predicate matrix. 

## FrameNet event annotation pilot
This folder contains the results of the event annotation pilot of July 2022
