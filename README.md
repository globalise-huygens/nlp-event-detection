# nlp-event-detection
This repository contains the pilot code for automatic event detection. It is a work in progress.
Currently, there are three finished folders: Experimental_automatic_frame_selection and FrameNet_event_annotation_pilot. Each folder has its own readme. 

## IAA analysis

## Experimental automatic frame selection
This is code that extracts English frames that correspond to modern Dutch translations of predicates taken from the General Letters from two datasets: the nl-luIndex and the predicate matrix. 

## FrameNet event annotation pilot
This folder contains the results of the event annotation pilot of July 2022
